# House Price Prediction - Kaggle Competition

This repository contains the notebook and data used for a house price prediction competition on Kaggle.

## Data Cleaning

The included dataset has been carefully cleaned to ensure its quality for modeling. This involved handling missing values, outliers, and any other inconsistencies that could impact the model's performance.

## Models

I implemented Catboost and XGBoost models to predict house prices based on the features in the dataset.

## Results

This project achieved a final ranking of 601th out of 104,217 participants! This is a very strong result for a first attempt at a Kaggle competition.

## Further Exploration

This repository provides a solid foundation for further exploration of house price prediction models. You can experiment with different feature engineering techniques, model architectures, and hyperparameter tuning to potentially improve the model's performance.
